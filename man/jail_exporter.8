.Nm jail_exporter
.Nd Prometheus exporter for jail metrics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl hV
.Op Fl Fl help

.Nm
.Op Fl Fl output.file-path Ns = Ns Ar path
.Op Fl Fl web.listen-address Ns = Ns Ar addr:port
.Op Fl Fl web.telemetry-path Ns = Ns Ar path
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm jail_exporter
is a Prometheus exporter for jail metrics.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl h , Fl Fl help
Prints help information
.It Fl V , Fl Fl version
Prints version information
.It Fl Fl output.file-path Ns = Ns Ar path
Specify a
.Ar path
to write collected metrics to.
When
.Nm
is given a
.Ar path
it will exit immediately after writing the metrics and the HTTPd will not be
started.
This option is designed to be paired with the Node Exporter Textfile Collector.
Giving a
.Ar path
of
.Dq Cm -
will output collected metrics to stdout.
.It Fl Fl web.listen-address Ns = Ns Ar addr:port
Specify an
.Ar addr:port
on which to expose the metrics and web interface.
Defaults to
.Dq Cm 127.0.0.1:9452 .
If specifying an IPv6
.Ar addr:port
the address portion should be enclosed within square brackets, for example:
.Dq Cm [::1]:9452 .
.It Fl Fl web.telemetry-path Ns = Ns Ar path
Specify a
.Ar path
under which to expose the metrics.
Defaults to
.Dq Cm /metrics .
.El
.Sh USAGE
.Nm
must be run as
.Dq root
in order to access the required
.Xr rctl 8
APIs.
Although
.Fx
ships with RACCT/RCTL support in the kernel, it is disabled by default.
It can be enabled by setting
.Va kern.racct.enabled Ns = Ns Qq Ar 1
in
.Pa /boot/loader.conf .
After setting this, a reboot will be required to enable RACCT/RCTL.
.Sh METRICS
The metrics that are exported are those listed in the RESOURCES section of
.Xr rctl 8 ,
and the following additional metrics:
.Bl -tag -width num
.It Va exporter_build_info
The version of the currently running exporter, and the version of Rust used to
build the exporter.
The version is given in the
.Dq version
label on the metric, while the Rust version used to build the exporter is given
in the
.Dq rustversion
label.
Does not possess a
.Dq name
label.
.It Va id
The ID of the named jail
.It Va num
The current number of jails running.
Does not possess a
.Dq name
label.
.El
.Pp
All metrics are prefixed with the string
.Dq jail_
and in most cases (except for the metrics mentioned above) possess a
.Dq name
label containing the name of the jail.
An example of a metric output by the exporter would be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# HELP jail_cputime_seconds_total CPU time, in seconds
# TYPE jail_cputime_seconds_total counter
jail_cputime_seconds_total{name="test"} 300
.Ed
.Sh "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.Nm
can also take its configuration from environment variables.
In the event that both command line options and environment variables are
specified, the command line options will win.
.Bl -tag -width JAIL_EXPORTER_WEB_LISTEN_ADDRESS
.It Ev JAIL_EXPORTER_OUTPUT_FILE_PATH
is equivalent to setting the
.Fl Fl output.file-path
option.
.It Ev JAIL_EXPORTER_WEB_LISTEN_ADDRESS
is equivalent to setting the
.Fl Fl web.listen-address
option.
.It Ev JAIL_EXPORTER_WEB_TELEMETRY_PATH
is equivalent to setting the
.Fl Fl web.telemetry-path
option.
